**Abstract:**
Privilege escalation is the process of giving authorized users more access and authority over a computer system or network than is appropriate. 
Hackers frequently try to get higher privileges by exploiting flaws in software, operating systems, or apps in order to access sensitive data, steal information,
or engage in other illegal acts. An attacker can increase privileges in a variety of ways, some of which include.
●	Security misconfiguration
●	Sudo shell escaping
